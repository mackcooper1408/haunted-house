# Three.js Haunted House

A spooky haunted house scene created with Three.js, highlighting some basic features of the library such as lighting, shadows, and textures along with simple animations (see the ghosts flying around). The gravestones are randomly dispersed, so you can refresh the page to see a different arrangement each time. You can move about the scene using the mouse to drag and rotate the camera view and the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

The project is based heavily on the [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/) haunted house tutorial.
